      "* **Summary:** The summary is decent but lacks a strong quantifiable achievement.  Instead of simply stating goals, highlight a key accomplishment or skill that directly relates to the target AI Engineer role.  For example, mention a specific project result (e.g., \"Improved model accuracy by 15% using hyperparameter tuning\").  Rewrite to be more impactful and concise.  Consider starting with a strong action verb.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Projects:** This section is the resume's strength.  The descriptions are detailed and showcase technical skills effectively. However, consider quantifying results whenever possible. For example, for \"Legal-Ease,\" mention the number of features implemented, users, or any measurable impact.  For \"PDF Summarization Tool,\" quantify the improvement in summarization quality (e.g., \"Reduced document length by X% while retaining Y% of key information\").  For \"Model Madness,\" mention the number of models supported or users who have utilized the platform.  Finally, for \"Enhanced Question Answering,\" specify the accuracy improvement percentage.  Adding quantifiable results significantly boosts the impact.\n",

      "* **Awards:**  The \"Awards\" section is too sparse.  Elaborate on the \"Compiler Construction Project.\" Briefly describe the project and its significance, and quantify the achievement if possible (e.g., \"Developed a compiler for [language] achieving X% efficiency improvement compared to existing solutions\").\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Skills:** This section is well-organized and comprehensive. However, group similar skills together for better readability. For instance, combine \"APIs & Backend Development\" and \"Web Development\" under a broader category like \"Software Development.\"  Consider using a skills matrix to visually represent your proficiency levels (e.g., beginner, intermediate, expert).\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Education and Certifications:** This section needs restructuring.  The certifications should be listed separately from the education.  Instead of repeating \"Credentials,\" use a consistent format for each certification, including the issuing institution, completion date, and a brief description of the skills gained.  Consider adding a GPA if it's above 3.5.  The dates for the Bachelor's degree should be formatted as MM/YYYY – MM/YYYY for better readability.\n",
